An in-house code which solves the steady Navier-Stokes equations,
using the Finite Volume Method (FVM) in primitive variables formulation.
Convective terms are discretized using second order central differencing scheme,
and SIMPLE algorithm are used to decouple velocity and pressure.
Strongly Implicit Procedure was used to solve the resulted linear algebraic equations.
